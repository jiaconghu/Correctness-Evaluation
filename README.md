![framework](framework.png)

Welcome to the official repository for the paper **"How Correct Is Your Vision Model? A Comprehensive Survey"**. This repository contains the experimental code and the comprehensive survey paper associated with our research.

## Overview

In this repository, you will find:
- The experimental code used in our survey.
- The comprehensive survey paper.

## Online Model Evaluation Platform

Based on our survey, we have developed an online model evaluation platform. You can access it at: [model-evaluation.vipazoo.com](http://model-evaluation.vipazoo.com).
